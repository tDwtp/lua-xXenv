 LuaCURL is a module providing Internet browsing capabilities based on the CURL library.
 The module interface follows strictly the CURl architecture and is very
 easy to use if the programmer has already experience with CURL. The only
 LuaCURL luaopen_luacurl public function register itself to the Lua context
 defining a namespace curl with one constructor and some utility functions.
 _COMENT OF THE DOCUMENTOR:_  Its just not well documented... so I played
 around with it. I just can't say if this all is right, but luacurl is
 awful to use! I even appreciate luasocket for this stuff. "(-.-)
 I also would appreciate somebody who can tell me how to use it correctly to
 document it correctly

 This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it needs to read data in
 order to send it to the peer. Your function must return the actual #number
 of bytes that you stored in that memory area. Returning 0 will signal
 end-of-file to the library and cause it to stop the current transfer. <br />
 <br />
 If you stop the current transfer by returning 0 "pre-maturely"
 (i.e before the server expected it, like when you've said you will upload N
 bytes and you upload less than N bytes), you may experience that the server
 "hangs" waiting for the rest of the data that won't come. <br />
 <br />
 The read callback may return @{#curl.READFUNC_ABORT} to stop the current
 operation immediately. <br />
 <br />
 _Bugs:_ when doing TFTP uploads, you must return the exact amount of data
 that the callback wants, or it will be considered the final packet by the
 server end and the transfer will end there. <br />

 This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received header data.
 The header callback will be called once for each header and only complete
 header lines are passed on to the callback. Parsing headers is very easy
 using this. The size of the data pointed to by ptr is size multiplied with
 nmemb. Do not assume that the header line is zero terminated! The pointer
 named userparam is the one you set with the @{#curl.OPT_HEADERDATA} option.
 The callback function must return the #number of bytes actually taken care
 of. If that amount differs from the amount passed to your function, it'll
 signal an error to the library. This will abort the transfer and return
 @{#curl.WRITE_ERROR}. <br/>
 <br/>
 It's important to note that the callback will be invoked for the headers of
 all responses received after initiating a request and not just the final
 response. This includes all responses which occur during authentication
 negotiation. If you need to operate on only the headers from the final
 response, you will need to collect headers in the callback yourself and use
 HTTP status lines, for example, to delimit response boundaries. <br/>
 <br/>
 When a server sends a chunked encoded transfer, it may contain a trailer.
 That trailer is identical to a HTTP header and if such a trailer is received
 it is passed to the application using this callback as well. There are
 several ways to detect it being a trailer and not an ordinary header: 1) it
 comes after the response-body. 2) it comes after the final header line
 (CR LF) 3) a Trailer: header among the regular response-headers mention what
 header(s) to expect in the trailer. <br/>
 <br/>

 called with the server responses to the commands that libcurl sends. <br/>

 This function gets called by libcurl instead of its internal equivalent with
 a frequent interval. While data is being transferred it will be called very
 frequently, and during slow periods like when nothing is being transferred
 it can slow down to about one call per second. <br />
 <br />
 userparam is the pointer set with @{#curl.OPT_PROGRESSDATA}, it is not
 actually used by libcurl but is only passed along from the application to
 the callback. <br />
 <br />
 The callback gets told how much data libcurl will transfer and has
 transferred, in #number of bytes. dltotal is the total #number of bytes
 libcurl expects to download in this transfer. dlnow is the #number of bytes
 downloaded so far. ultotal is the total #number of bytes libcurl expects to
 upload in this transfer. ulnow is the #number of bytes uploaded so far. <br />
 <br />
 Unknown/unused argument values passed to the callback will be set to zero
 (like if you only download data, the upload size will remain 0). Many times
 the callback will be called one or more times first, before it knows the
 data sizes so a program must be made to handle that. <br />
 CURLOPT_NOPROGRESS must be set to 0 to make this function actually get called. <br />

 HTTP headers to pass to the server in your HTTP request.
 If you add a header with no content as in 'Accept:' (no data on the right
 side of the colon), the internally used header will get disabled. Thus,
 using this option you can add new headers, replace internal headers and
 remove internal headers. To add a header with no content (nothing to the
 right side of the colon), use the form 'MyHeader;' (note the ending
 semicolon). <br />
 <br />
 The headers included in the list must not be CRLF-terminated, because curl
 adds CRLF after each header item. Failure to comply with this will result
 in strange bugs because the server will most likely ignore part of the
 headers you specified. <br />
 <br />
 The first line in a request (containing the method, usually a GET or POST)
 is not a header and cannot be replaced using this option. Only the lines
 following the request-line are headers. Adding this method line in this list
 of headers will only cause your request to send an invalid header. <br />
 <br />
 Pass a #nil to this to reset back to no custom headers. <br />

 If it is true, libcurl will not use any functions that install signal
 handlers or any functions that cause signals to be sent to the process.
 This option is mainly here to allow multi-threaded unix applications to
 still set/use all timeout options etc, without risking getting signals. <br />
 <br />
 If this option is set and libcurl has been built with the standard name
 resolver, timeouts will not occur while the name resolve takes place.
 Consider building libcurl with c-ares support to enable asynchronous DNS
 lookups, which enables nice timeouts for name resolves without signals. <br />
 <br />
 Setting @{#curl.OPT_NOSIGNAL} to 1 makes libcurl NOT ask the system to ignore
 SIGPIPE signals, which otherwise are sent by the system when trying to send
 data to a socket which is closed in the other end. libcurl makes an effort
 to never cause such SIGPIPEs to trigger, but some operating systems have no
 way to avoid them and even on those that have there are some corner cases
 when they may still happen, contrary to our desire. In addition, using
 CURLAUTH_NTLM_WB authentication could cause a SIGCHLD signal to be raised. <br />

 This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where non-successful
 response codes will slip through, especially when authentication is involved
 (response codes 401 and 407). <br />
 <br />
 You might get some amounts of headers transferred before this situation is
 detected, like when a "100-continue" is received as a response to a POST/PUT

 A parameter set to 1 tells the library to prepare for an upload. The

 options are also interesting for uploads. If the protocol is HTTP, uploading
 means using the PUT request unless you tell libcurl otherwise. <br />
 <br />
 Using PUT with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.
 You can disable this header with @{#curl.OPT_HTTPHEADER} as usual. <br />
 <br />
 If you use PUT to a HTTP 1.1 server, you can upload data without knowing the
 size before starting the transfer if you use chunked encoding. You enable
 this by adding a header like "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" with @{#curl.OPT_HTTPHEADER}.

 <br />
 Use @{#curl.OPT_POSTFIELDS} option to specify what data to post and
 @{#curl.OPT_POSTFIELDSIZE} or @{#curl.OPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE} to set the data size. <br />
 Optionally, you can provide data to POST using the @{#curl.OPT_READFUNCTION}

 @{#curl.OPT_POSTFIELDS} to anything but #nil. When providing data with a
 callback, you must transmit it using chunked transfer-encoding or you must
 set the size of the data with the @{#curl.OPT_POSTFIELDSIZE} or
 @{#curl.OPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE} option. To enable chunked encoding, you
 simply pass in the appropriate Transfer-Encoding header. <br />
 <br />
 You can override the default POST Content-Type: header by setting your own

 Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.
 You can disable this header with CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER as usual. <br />

 Maximizing the amount of data sent per TCP segment is good because it

 This POST is a normal application/x-www-form-urlencoded kind (and libcurl

 the most commonly used one by HTML forms. See also the @{#curl.OPT_POST}.
 Using @{#curl.OPT_POSTFIELDS} implies @{#curl.OPT_POST}. <br />

 The #string can be used to specify the request instead of GET or HEAD when

 DELETE request or a POP3 DELE command. <br />

 Please don't perform this at will, on HTTP based requests, by making sure
 your server supports the command you are sending first. <br />

 When you change the request method by setting @{#curl.OPT_CUSTOMREQUEST}
 to something, you don't actually change how libcurl behaves or acts in
 regards to the particular request method, it will only change the actual
 string sent in the request. <br />
 <br />
 For example: <br />
 + With the HTTP protocol when you tell libcurl to do a HEAD request, but then
 specify a GET though a custom request libcurl will still act as if it sent
 a HEAD. To switch to a proper HEAD use @{#curl.OPT_NOBODY}, to switch to a
 proper POST use @{#curl.OPT_POST} or @{#curl.OPT_POSTFIELDS} and to switch
 to a proper GET use @{#curl.OPT_HTTPGET}. <br />
 + With the POP3 protocol when you tell libcurl to use a custom request it
 will behave like a LIST or RETR command was sent where it expects data to
 be returned by the server. As such @{#curl.OPT_NOBODY} should be used when
 specifying commands such as DELE and NOOP for example. <br />
 <br />
 Restore to the internal default by setting this to #nil. <br />
 <br />
 Many people have wrongly used this option to replace the entire request
 with their own, including multiple headers and POST contents. While that
 might work in many cases, it will cause libcurl to send invalid requests
 and it could possibly confuse the remote server badly. Use
 @{#curl.OPT_POST} and @{#curl.OPT_POSTFIELDS} to set POST data. Use
 @{#curl.OPT_HTTPHEADER} to replace or extend the set of headers sent by
 libcurl. Use @{#curl.OPT_HTTP_VERSION} to change HTTP version. <br />

 requests to possibly different hosts. libcurl will only send this user and
 password information to hosts using the initial host name (unless
 @{#curl.OPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH} is set), so if libcurl follows locations to
 other hosts it will not send the user and password to those. This is enforced
 to prevent accidental information leakage. <br />
 <br />
 At present only IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support login options as part of the
 details #string. For more information about the login options please see <a target="_blank" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2384"> RFC 2384 </a>,

 This option determines whether libcurl verifies that the server cert is for the server it is known as.
 When negotiating a SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity. <br />
 + When @{#curl.OPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST} is 2, that certificate must indicate that
 the server is the server to which you meant to connect, or the connection fails. <br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Curl considers the server the intended one when the Common Name field or a
 Subject Alternate Name field in the certificate matches the host name in
 the @{curl.OPT_URL} to which you told Curl to connect. <br />
 + When the value is 1, libcurl will return a failure. <br />
 <br />
 It was previously (in 7.28.0 and earlier) a debug option of some sorts, but
 it is no longer supported due to frequently leading to programmer mistakes. <br />
 <br />
 When the value is 0, the connection succeeds regardless of the names in the certificate. <br />
 <br />
 This option controls checking the server's certificate's claimed identity.
 The server could be lying. To control lying, see @{#curl.OPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER}.

--[[-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This option determines whether curl verifies the authenticity of the peer's certificate.
 true means curl verifies; false means it doesn't. <br />
 <br />
 When negotiating a SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating
 its identity. Curl verifies whether the certificate is authentic, i.e. that
 you can trust that the server is who the certificate says it is. This trust
 is based on a chain of digital signatures, rooted in certification authority
 (CA) certificates you supply. curl uses a default bundle of CA certificates
 (the path for that is determined at build time) and you can specify alternate
 certificates with the @{#curl.OPT_CAINFO} option or the @{#curl.OPT_CAPATH} option. <br />
 <br />
 When @{#curl.OPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER} is true, and the verification fails to
 prove that the certificate is authentic, the connection fails. When the
 option is false, the peer certificate verification succeeds regardless. <br />
 <br />
 Authenticating the certificate is not by itself very useful. You typically
 want to ensure that the server, as authentically identified by its certificate
 is the server you mean to be talking to. Use @{#curl.OPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST} to
 control that. The check that the host name in the certificate is valid for
 the host name you're connecting to is done independently of the @{#curl.OPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER} option. <br />

 The #string will be used to get the IP address to use for the FTP PORT instruction.
 The PORT instruction tells the remote server to connect to our specified
 IP address. The string may be a plain IP address, a host name, a network
 interface name (under Unix) or just a '-' symbol to let the library use your
 system's default IP address. Default FTP operations are passive, and thus
 won't use PORT. <br />
 <br />
 The address can be followed by a ':' to specify a port, optionally followed
 by a '-' to specify a port range. If the port specified is 0, the operating
 system will pick a free port. If a range is provided and all ports in the
 range are not available, libcurl will report @{#curl.FTP_PORT_FAILED} for
 the handle. Invalid port/range settings are ignored. IPv6 addresses followed
 by a port or portrange have to be in brackets. IPv6 addresses without
 port/range specifier can be in brackets. (added in 7.19.5) <br />
