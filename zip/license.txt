:: for the default stuff ::
its taken from the wiki [1] and copied... there is no license provided,
so I copied it. Sorry if i should not, i dont even know who/where I should ask
for permission... (I think the questionmark means no license...)

:: for the documentation of other copied documents ::
Sorry people, i couldnt find theirs.
I copied most, text but reworked it (so you can see it properly inside Koneki)


:: for wx ::
F**K YOU!!! I HATE YOU!!!
I TRIED IT SEVEREL TIMES AND NEEDED TO REWORK IT (due to errors)
I EVEN MADE A SCRIPT (in lua) TO CONVERT IT TO THAT DAMN FILE WITH NO, NOT EVEN
A BIT OF EXPLANATION. I AM FUCKING TIRED OF RE DO MY WORK AGAIN.
but i just did some awesome shit, so you have the names, but not derived stuff
or even proper Constructors (i tried, but it f**ks up my script). I even needed
to modify the luadocumentor, and the stack of lua (wich was UNBELIEVABLY un-
comfortable and quited normal scripts. BACKUPS HURAY!)
IF ANYBODY WANTS TO HELP: you dont want it! I know what i am talking of...
